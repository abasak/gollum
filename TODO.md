# TODO

* Add support for versioning of wiki pages using git branch.
  * This should allow creating different versions of the same wiki by using git branches. So if someone wants to create a new version of the same wiki without modifying the existing one, all she needs to do is...
      * Checkout a new branch.
      * Do the required changes and commit.
  * There should be a dropdown somewhere that can be used to access different versions.
* Add support for multiple git repositories.
